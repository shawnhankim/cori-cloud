Bring Your Own License (BYOL)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- BYOL is process you can use to deploy software that you already have license. 
- When you BYOL, you are responsible for managing your own licenses. 
- You are responsible for managing true ups and renewals as required 
  under your Volume Licensing agreement. 
- In addition, you must submit a new verification form when you renew your 
  agreement and when you deploy any previously unverified products.

Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A certificate signing request (CSR) is one of the first steps towards getting
  your own SSL Certificate. Generated on the same server you plan to install the
  certificate on, the CSR contains information (e.g. common name, organization,
  country) the Certificate Authority (CA) will use to create your certificate. 
  It also contains the public key that will be included in your certificate and
  is signed with the corresponding private key. We’ll go into more details on 
  the roles of these keys below.

Identity Providers (IdP)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- An Identity Provider (IdP), sometimes called an Identity Service Provider or 
  Identity Assertion Provider, is an online service or website that authenticates
  users on the Internet by means of security tokens, one of which is SAML 2.0. In 
  the WS-Federation Model an Identity Provider is a Security Token Service (STS). 
  Service Providers depend on an Identity Provider or Security Token Service to do
  the user authentication. OAuth is an important protocol for IdP services as most
  major web services are also identity providers, mainly through the use of OAuth.
  These include Google, Facebook, Yahoo, AOL, Microsoft, PayPal, MySpace, and 
  Flickr among many more. Furthermore, all major email providers offer OAuth IDP 
  (Identity Provider) services.

SAML
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a standard protocol for web
  browser Single Sign-On (SSO) using secure tokens. SAML completely eliminates 
  all passwords and instead uses standard cryptography and digital signatures to
  pass a secure sign-in token from an identity provider to a SaaS application. 
  If you are an IT administrator, SAML can help you securely eliminate passwords
  and deploy applications much faster. If you are an application vendor, SAML
  can help you secure your application, reduce development costs and reach 
  greater and faster adoption.

IDP
A Service Provider (SP) is an entity that provides Web Services. ... In the WS-Federation model a Service Provider is called a “Relying Party” (RP). In SAML, the XML-standard for exchanging data, the security domains that information is passed between are a Service Provider (SP) and an Identity Provider (IdP).
