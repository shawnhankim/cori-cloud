Identity Providers (IdP)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- An IdP, sometimes called an Identity Service Provider or Identity Assertion
  Provider, is an online service or website that authenticates users on the 
  Internet by means of security tokens, one of which is SAML 2.0. 

- In the WS-Federation Model an IdP is a Security Token Service (STS). 

- Service Providers depend on an Identity Provider or Security Token Service to do
  the user authentication. OAuth is an important protocol for IdP services as most
  major web services are also identity providers, mainly through the use of OAuth.
  
- These include Google, Facebook, Yahoo, AOL, Microsoft, PayPal, MySpace, and 
  Flickr among many more. Furthermore, all major email providers offer OAuth IdP 
  (Identity Provider) services.

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- SAML is a standard protocol for web browser Single Sign-On (SSO) using secure
  tokens. SAML completely eliminates all passwords and instead uses standard 
  cryptography and digital signatures to pass a secure sign-in token from an 
  identity provider to a SaaS application. 

- If you are an IT administrator, SAML can help you securely eliminate passwords
  and deploy applications much faster. 
  
- If you are an application vendor, SAML can help you secure your application, 
  reduce development costs and reach greater and faster adoption.

MTLS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mutual authentication or two-way authentication refers to two parties authenticating each other at the same time, being a default mode of authentication in some protocols (IKE, SSH) and optional in others (TLS).

By default the TLS protocol only proves the identity of the server to the client using X.509 certificate and the authentication of the client to the server is left to the application layer. TLS also offers client-to-server authentication using client-side X.509 authentication.[1] As it requires provisioning of the certificates to the clients and involves less user-friendly experience, it's rarely used in end-user applications.

Mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) is much more widespread in business-to-business (B2B) applications, where a limited number of programmatic and homogeneous clients are connecting to specific web services, the operational burden is limited and security requirements are usually much higher as compared to consumer environments.

Better institution-to-customer authentication would prevent attackers from successfully impersonating financial institutions to steal customers' account credentials; and better customer-to-institution authentication would prevent attackers from successfully impersonating customers to financial institutions in order to perpetrate fraud

Most Mutual authentication is machine-to-machine, leaving it up to chance whether or not users will notice (or care) when the remote authentication fails (e.g. a red address bar browser padlock, or a wrong domain name). Non-technical mutual-authentication also exists to mitigate this problem, requiring the user to complete a challenge, effectively forcing them to notice, and blocking them from authenticating with a false endpoint.

Mutual authentication is of two types:

Certificate based
User name-password based
