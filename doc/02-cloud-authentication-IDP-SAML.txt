Identity Providers (IdP)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- An IdP, sometimes called an Identity Service Provider or Identity Assertion
  Provider, is an online service or website that authenticates users on the 
  Internet by means of security tokens, one of which is SAML 2.0. 

- In the WS-Federation Model an IdP is a Security Token Service (STS). 

- Service Providers depend on an Identity Provider or Security Token Service to do
  the user authentication. OAuth is an important protocol for IdP services as most
  major web services are also identity providers, mainly through the use of OAuth.
  
- These include Google, Facebook, Yahoo, AOL, Microsoft, PayPal, MySpace, and 
  Flickr among many more. Furthermore, all major email providers offer OAuth IdP 
  (Identity Provider) services.

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- SAML is a standard protocol for web browser Single Sign-On (SSO) using secure
  tokens. SAML completely eliminates all passwords and instead uses standard 
  cryptography and digital signatures to pass a secure sign-in token from an 
  identity provider to a SaaS application. 

- If you are an IT administrator, SAML can help you securely eliminate passwords
  and deploy applications much faster. 
  
- If you are an application vendor, SAML can help you secure your application, 
  reduce development costs and reach greater and faster adoption.
