Bring Your Own License (BYOL)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- BYOL is process you can use to deploy software that you already have license. 
- When you BYOL, you are responsible for managing your own licenses. 
- You are responsible for managing true ups and renewals as required 
  under your Volume Licensing agreement. 
- In addition, you must submit a new verification form when you renew your 
  agreement and when you deploy any previously unverified products.


Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A certificate signing request (CSR) is one of the first steps towards getting
  your own SSL Certificate. Generated on the same server you plan to install the
  certificate on, the CSR contains information (e.g. common name, organization,
  country) the Certificate Authority (CA) will use to create your certificate. 
  It also contains the public key that will be included in your certificate and
  is signed with the corresponding private key. Weâ€™ll go into more details on 
  the roles of these keys below.
